# Motion Detection for Tendonitis Prevention

## Overview

This project utilizes Python with OpenCV and Mediapipe to create an interactive application aimed at preventing tendonitis by detecting hand movements. The application monitors and counts how many times the hand is opened, displaying progress and visual rewards such as stars as exercises are completed.

For more details, please visit the [project documentation](https://www.jaccon.com.br/criando-software-para-previnir-a-tendinite/).

## Features

- Real-time Motion Detection: Uses the camera to detect and analyze hand movements.
- Automatic Exercise Counting: Tracks how many times the hand is opened during exercises.
- Progress Visualization: Displays a progress bar and achieved levels to motivate the user.
- Visual Rewards: Shows stars as visual incentives as exercises are completed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script `python motion_detection.py` to start the application.
